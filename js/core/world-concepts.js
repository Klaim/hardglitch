// This file describes the core concepts that exist in the game mechanics.
// This is not a modelisation of these concept, just rules of how things
// work in the game system. For example, we can say what an "object" is,
// what rules can be applied on it and what interface it should have to work
// in our system.
// Think about it this way: code here could be reused to make another similar
// game, without being changed too much.
// We will describe what kind of entities can exist here.
